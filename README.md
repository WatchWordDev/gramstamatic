# Gramstamatic

Share photos with your friends, without handing all your sensitive data over to Facebook. 

(In other words, it's like Instagram, but without the intrusive data surveillance and incessant marketing!)

## Description

This implementation began as the output from a TailwindCSS tutorial that I adapted and expanded. Right now it includes working login and signup functions, as well as the ability to follow other accounts, like photos, and comment on photos. 


See [Roadmap](#Roadmap) below for planned upgrades.
